# Scalable_datawarehouse_llm_finetuning

#overview

This project aims to gather diverse data from various sources using web scraping techniques. Once collected, the data will undergo a thorough cleaning and preprocessing phase. Following the cleaning process, the data will be organized and structured in a manner that facilitates its suitability for fine-tuning purposes.

Data will be collected from diverse online sources, including news websites, blogs, and social media platforms.
The collected data will undergo cleaning and processing to ensure its quality and relevance. It will be stored in a structured database, making it easily accessible for various NLP tasks. Additionally, APIs will be developed to facilitate seamless integration and querying of the dataset, enabling the company to leverage this resource effectively.

#steps

First, we will conduct an identification of potential data sources by researching and creating a list. These sources may include news websites, blogs, social media platforms, online forums, and digital libraries. We will prioritize these sources based on the quality and quantity of available content.

Next, we will proceed with setting up our development environment. This involves installing the necessary tools and libraries such as Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium. Additionally, we will establish version control using Git and create a repository on GitHub to track our project's progress.

Utilizing Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium, we will develop web scraping scripts. These scripts will allow us to extract data from the identified sources efficiently.

To ensure proper data management, we will design an appropriate SQL for storing the raw data. This schema will provide a structured format for organizing the collected information.
